Reinders, fourth year of the fortress
Granite 1: After a year of mediocrity, followed by a bloody rout of our builders, I took receipt of the fortress. Bodies litter the surface. Goblin squads made short work of the military and civilians. No warning bell was rung. It's a massacre, a tragedy rarely seen in this scale. The goblins will pay. But I'm not going out there. No, fuck that, we're staying down here, behind our wall of traps, until those goblins disappear and we might have a chance.

We need towers. Crossbow towers. But I fear this ice is going to melt before we get the chance, and I don't know what we'll do then. I'm not organizing an aquifer punch. No, no, no. Just not going to happen.

Our whole farm organization is insane. Basically, we don't have one at all. We have no textile industry at all - not sure how anyone expects to get anything done without bags. Bags - one in every room.

Did I mention the surface? It's a horror movie. The corpses of soldiers, indicated only by the shiny metal badges they'd pulled out and pinned to their worn clothing, strew the outer entrance. Just let the goblins hit the traps! That's what they're there for. But no, no, now we have corpses.

And no rail system exists in here. I need to build one. I don't know the first thing about physics, but I know design, so I'm not going to build automation - leave that for whoever fucks up the lives of hundreds when I'm gone. My goal, pure and simple, is to see us through tomorrow.

Granite 6: Some idiot decided to make armor out of gold.

Granite 12: BARONY, BITCHES! Aw, man, after that disaster, I thought our fortress was doomed. Of course, the loser who killed thirty dwarves gets it - maybe I should just kill him off. Oh, but murder is baaaaaaaad. It's punishable seveeeeeerely. God, I sound like my mother.

But I'm still in fucking charge, so suck it, Retard Leader.

Granite 14: AGH, FUCK. FUCK FUCKITY FUCK FUCK I'M GOING TO PUNCH SOMETHING. WHAT IS THIS FUCKING FORTRESS FUCK I HATE EVERYTHING

21st Granite: Actually made the outside a wall - well, part of it. There are still goblins to the north, but they're too stupid to rush the fortress and get chewed apart by the weapons traps. I apologize, my precious notebook, for the rage a week ago. I was having a really shitty day. The left south side of the map is totally sealed off, now - except for one wall well away from a goblin crossbowman with no bolts stuck in a pit, which still manages to fuck up every job that occurs anywhere in the fortress. Dwarves, he's for taunting, not for cowering in fear from. Remedied by restricting the viewing area, so only idiots with something to prove will walk up.

Slate 3: Goblins strike! The scum lining our fortress, standing on a hill and waiting to pounce, saw a mother with her child and decided to attack, with superior weapons and numbers. One such goblin was incapacitated before we yelled "YOU'RE CONSCRIPTED" at which point the mine-worker beat the second macegoblin around the head, while holding a baby. Her completely-lost arm will be a thing of legend, and she will be given a hero's welcome when she gets back from stabbing the unconscious goblin. This is truly a glorious day. Maybe she should go take out that crossbowgoblin down there.

Slate 4: Muddled reports have come in about the hero of the day, taking out two goblins to save her baby's life, armed with nothing but her pick. She is fine; tragically, it's her baby who will grow up missing an arm. Her, and her baby's, sacrifices have saved us all. On interview, Udil Dastotisan said "It was exhilarating. There's nothing like the rush from headbutting a goblin and beating another one to death." Ast Zansongerush was heard, upon hearing the news, to say "Praise the miners! Today we are saved."

Slate 19: Eh.

Felsite 7: Started making the drop shaft. I'll HAVE to organize it better, but it'll get ores moved a little bit faster. I can organize the movements via stockpile and make the whole system of management a little more efficient. Forgot, but I'm going to put a peasant in the forges - gotta move those bars around eventually.

Felsite 21: TROGDOOOOOOR! We had a visit from our second dragon. All dwarves were safe, save the broker, who died in the crossfire of a noble effort on the part of the dragon to burn elves and their goods as thoroughly as possible. Unfortunately for the dragon, there were weapons traps in the way. Unfortunately for us, we didn't catch a dragon. Unfortunately for the elves, no one cares about fucking elves. We may go to war soon.

Checkpoint

Hematite 10: Lost our armorer to a vampire. Found drained of blood in the forges. This will not stand! And now we're going to have a very hard time armoring our military.

Malachite 9: You know what? Fuck this shit. A peasant came up to me and said he was sad that he had to stand and eat his food. I showed him my "office" and threw him to the GROOOOOUUUUUND.
Then I flipped half the tables in the dining hall and stormed off to my room. Not my best moment.

Malachite 23: Vampire hunt: I am looking for "dwarves" with a huge number of associations (past civilizations of which that dwarf was a part). This is a strong indicator of vampirism, because it is a strong indicator of age. Age isn't foolproof, but vampires tend to last for a while.
